## Requirements Verification

### Main Screen Scrollable Feed of Events
- **Verification Plan**: 
  - Each requirement will be checked and validated through a thorough testing plan.

### Acceptance Testing
- **Frontend Requirements**:
  - **Scrollable Event Feed**: 
    - **Test**: Ensure the main screen displays events in a scrollable list in chronological order.
    - **Pass Criteria**: Events load properly, are scrollable, and in the correct order.
  
  - **Event Detail Screen**: 
    - **Test**: Every event detail screen should display the event name, location, time, and food offered.
    - **Pass Criteria**: All details are visible correctly and error-free.
  
  - **Filtering Functionality**: 
    - **Test**: Verify location, type of food, and event duration filters function correctly.
    - **Pass Criteria**: Events feed updates promptly based on filter changes.

  - **Responsive Design**: 
    - **Test**: Check the website's appearance on desktops and mobile devices.
    - **Pass Criteria**: Layout adjusts smoothly depending on screen size.

- **Backend Requirements**:
  - **Scraping and Integrating Data**: 
    - **Test**: Verify integration with the Instagram API fetches event posts accurately.
    - **Pass Criteria**: Events are parsed and stored correctly without duplication or data loss.

  - **API Development**: 
    - **Test**: Ensure all API endpoints respond correctly to valid and invalid requests.
    - **Pass Criteria**: Proper HTTP status codes are returned; data integrity is maintained.

## Testing Strategies

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Write unit tests for components using testing frameworks like Jest (frontend) and Go's testing package (backend).
  
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Ensure various application components interact as expected.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: 
  - Simulate user interactions from start to finish to verify expected behavior.

### Manual Testing
- **Usability Testing**: 
  - Conduct user sessions to identify usability issues.

- **Responsive Testing**: 
  - Manually verify the application's appearance on different devices and browsers.

- **Security Testing**: 
  - Manually check for vulnerabilities not covered by automated tests.

### Code Reviews
- **Peer Review**: 
  - Implement mandatory code reviews through GitHub Pull Requests.

### Continuous Verification
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: 
  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing on pushes and pull requests.

- **Automated Tests**: 
  - Run unit and integration tests automatically to ensure functionality remains intact.

### Code Quality Tools
- **Linting**: 
  - Configure ESLint for front-end TypeScript code and GolangCI-Lint for Go backend code to maintain consistency.

- **Static Analysis**: 
  - Use tools like SonarQube for early detection of potential issues.
